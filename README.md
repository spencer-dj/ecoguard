# EcoGuard — AI-Powered Wildlife Monitoring System

EcoGuard is an intelligent wildlife monitoring system designed to detect poachers and track animal movements. It uses XGBoost for behavioral prediction and Keras (TensorFlow) for image classification, integrated into a Django backend and React frontend dashboard.

---

## Project Overview

EcoGuard’s goal is to assist game park rangers in monitoring wildlife and detecting possible poaching activities.  
It continuously analyzes animal movement data and, when a suspicious pattern (potential poacher) is detected, automatically triggers camera traps for image classification.

### Key Features
- Animal tracking (elephants, rhinos, etc.)
- Poacher detection using machine learning (XGBoost + PyTorch)
- Live map dashboard that updates every 60 seconds
- Camera trap image classification (Poacher / Elephant / Rhino)
- Admin dashboard built with React
- RESTful APIs for model results (`/api/xgb-results/` and `/api/image-results/`)
